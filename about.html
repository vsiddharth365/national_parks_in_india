	      <p>
                 The Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests defines a national park as a region declared by an state government 
                 as a natural park for the motive of protecting and nurturing the wildlife existing there, pertaining to its ecological,
		 floral, faunal, zoological, or geomorphological significance or association. Any human activity is not allowed inside a
                 national park except under specific permissions of the authorities associated to wildlife conservation. There were only 
                 five national parks in India by 1970. The enaction of Wildlife Protection Act in 1972 and Project Tiger in 1973 led to the 
                 creation of more national parks in India.

           	 National parks in India are regarded as category II protected areas by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
           	 The first national park in India, established in 1936 and named as Halley National Park, is now known as Jim Corbett National 
           	 Park in Uttarakhand. As of 2021, there are 106 national parks in India which account for 1.33% of the total area of the country, 
                 that is, 43,716 sq. km. Conservation of wildlife is a genuine need of the hour to preserve the threatened species and maintain a 
                 balance in our ecosystem.
